I use TDD approach. 
1.  Check if all of the seats are avaliable for sale.
    * check if return true if all seats available
    * check if return false if one seat is not available
2. Check if all of the seats are Allocates
    * check if return true if all seats Allocated
    * check if return false if there is  seat Available
3. Check if number of seats requestes from 1 to 3
    * check if return true if number of seats requestes = 3
    * check if return false if number of seats requestes = 0
    * check if return false if number of seats requestes = 4
4. Assume theatre is empty scenario
    * check if number of seats requested is = 1, I will be allocated the first seat A1.
    * check if number of seats requested is = 2, I will be allocated the 2 seats A1,A2.
